# Fractal-Dimension-Project
This project estimates the fractal (box-counting) dimension of India's coastline using Python. It involves processing a map image, applying the box-counting algorithm, and plotting a log-log graph to compute the coastlineâ€™s fractal dimension, revealing the self-similar nature of geographical boundaries
