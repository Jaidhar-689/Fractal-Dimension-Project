# Fractal-Dimension-Project
This project estimates the fractal dimension of India's coastline using the box-counting method, demonstrating the self-similarity and complexity of natural geographic boundaries.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Apply fractal geometry to a real-world object: India's coastline.

Use image processing techniques to extract the coastline boundary.

Implement the box-counting algorithm in Python to calculate the fractal (Hausdorff) dimension.

Visualize the scaling relationship between box size and box count on a log-log plot.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
NumPy, Pandas â€“ Numerical computation

matplotlib â€“ Data visualization

ðŸ“ˆ Method
Preprocess the coastline image (grayscale â†’ binary â†’ edge detection).

Overlay square grids of varying sizes.

Count how many boxes contain a part of the coastline for each grid size.

Plot log(N) vs log(1/Îµ) and determine the slope as the fractal dimension.

ðŸ“Š Results
Estimated Fractal Dimension: â‰ˆ 1.198

Indicates that the Indian coastline has a structure more complex than a straight line but less than a plane.

ðŸ“Ž Applications
Geographical analysis

Pattern recognition

Environmental modeling
